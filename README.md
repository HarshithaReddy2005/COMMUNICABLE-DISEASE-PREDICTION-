This project focuses on the development of a deep learning-based system for the prediction of communicable diseases using symptom inputs, with the primary goal of enabling early diagnosis and reducing the spread of infections, especially in remote or underserved areas. The model is trained on a curated dataset containing symptom-disease mappings derived from medical literature and verified health sources. The core idea is to build an intelligent system that can analyze a user's reported symptoms and accurately predict the most likely communicable disease, such as influenza, dengue, malaria, tuberculosis, or COVID-19. The project involves several stages, including extensive data preprocessing (handling missing values, encoding categorical symptoms, balancing class distributions), feature extraction, and deep learning model design using neural networks. We experimented with various architectures such as feedforward neural networks and LSTM-based models to capture both static and sequential patterns in symptoms. The model is evaluated using key metrics like accuracy, precision, recall, and F1-score, ensuring that it generalizes well to unseen data. Additionally, the project is designed with a user-friendly web interface where individuals can input their symptoms and instantly receive a prediction, which could serve as a preliminary health advisory tool. The application is particularly aimed at supporting populations in rural areas with limited access to healthcare professionals, allowing them to take timely medical action. The entire system is built using Python with deep learning frameworks like TensorFlow/Keras, and the web interface is developed using Flask or a similar lightweight framework. This project demonstrates the potential of artificial intelligence in enhancing public health responses and making healthcare more accessible and proactive.
